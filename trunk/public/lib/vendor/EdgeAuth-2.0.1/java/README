COMPILING:
################################################################################
AkamaiToken uses ant. To compile simply cd to the project root (usually this
directory) and type "ant".  This will compile the library and create a jar file
for inclusion in your project.  For those use to typing "make" there's a
makefile that will run ant appropriately as well.

USAGE:

command-line:
	todo...

library:
	see the source code in the AkamaiTokenTest.java file for an example of how
	to use the token generation library.  There are quite a few overloaded
	methods for the more common use-cases of the library but all result in the
	generation of an EdgeAuth 2.0 Token.
