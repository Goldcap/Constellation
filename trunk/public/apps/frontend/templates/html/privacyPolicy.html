<h2 class="about_title">Constellation Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Last Revised: June 21, 2011</p>


		<p>
	Constellation, Inc. ("Constellation") is concerned about your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how it collects, uses and shares your information. Constellation collects some or all of the following information whenever you sign up for or use the various Constellation services and products, including without limitation the Constellation Web site, any other Web site owned or operated by Constellation (each a "Site"), online mobile service, and/or purchase movie or other event tickets, or other products or services offered by Constellation or any affiliate (collectively, the "Service"). Some of this information is collected automatically and some is collected only when you provide it voluntarily.
  </p>
  <p>Constellation is not designed or intended for use by children under 13. If you are under 18, you should use Constellation only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not submit any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
  </p>
  <h4>Anti-Spam Policy</h4>
  <p>Constellation is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam"). We do not have any desire to send unsolicited marketing emails to anyone without permission and we do not sell or provide email addresses to any unauthorized third party in violation of this Privacy Policy. If you receive any unsolicited emails from spammers, please be assured that Constellation did not provide your email address to such parties.
  </p>
  <p>This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. Unfortunately, spammers obtain email addresses in a number of devious ways, including when you respond and ask to be taken off a spam email list, and in some cases by just generating emails to millions of random email addresses in the hopes of getting a few "live" ones. Please be assured that at Constellation we hate spam as much as you do, and we do our best to avoid contributing to it.
  </p>
  <p>All of our newsletters and other general email marketing communications also include an "unsubscribe" opt-out link that you may use to ask that we discontinue such emails to you. (Even if you opt-out of our newsletter or other marketing communications, we may still send you certain transactional or administrative emails, such as email tickets, recommendations, or invitations if a third party has entered your email address and wishes to invite you to a screening on Constellation.)
  </p>
  <p>All that said, if you believe that you have gotten unsolicited email from us, please <a href="mailto: info@constellation.tv">Contact Us</a> and we will investigate. If you prefer not to receive any further marketing communications from us, just tell us and we'll try to make sure you never hear from us again.
  </p>

When you sign up for or use the Site or other Service, Constellation collects some amount of Personally Identifiable Information from you. Constellation also collects Personally Identifiable Information that you may voluntarily provide when you use the Site or other Service, that you may disclose in a public area of the Site or other Service (such as a rating/review page, message board or chat room), or that you may include if you communicate with Constellation. In addition, when you use certain features of the Site or other Service (such as sending email invitations to others), Constellation will collect the email addresses or other Personally Identifiable Information of others that you may provide for such purposes.

This information also may include the movies for which you buy tickets. Constellation also collects information that does not include Personally Identifiable Information when you voluntarily provide it (such as in response to a questionnaire or survey) or post it to a public area of the Site or other Service (such as a rating/review page, message board or chat room).

Constellation uses pixels to track usage of the Site or other Service.
  </p>
  <h4>Other Methods.</h4>

  <h4>Personally Identifiable Information.</h4>
  <p>Constellation uses your Personally Identifiable Information to notify you of changes to the Site or other Service, to let you know about movies or other entertainment opportunities, and other products or services you may be interested in, and to request your participation in surveys or other promotions. You can choose not to receive certain communications from Constellation as described in the section below entitled "Receiving Communications and Opting Out." Constellation also uses your Personally Identifiable Information to process and fulfill your purchases, provide you with information that you request, and deliver content to you that is relevant to your interests. Constellation will use the email addresses you provide to send your screening invitations and recommendations to others.
  </p>

  <h4>Aggregate Information</h4>

However, in the event that you expressly opt-in via the Site or other Service to receive particular products or services, or information about products or services, that are offered by third parties, or otherwise authorize us to do so, we will share your Personally Identifiable Information with those third parties as appropriate for those limited purposes. Constellation may also share with those same third parties certain limited personal information that, without other information, does not specifically identify you.
  </p>
  <h4>Sharing with Social Networks or Other Sites You May Authorize</h4>
  <p>If you are a member of a social network service (such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc.) or you use other Internet sites where you have authorized them to gather information about your online behavior on Constellation (for instance, to notify your friends that you have joined a screening), including participation in any behavioral reporting program that they may operate on or off of their own site (i.e., Facebook Beacon, etc.), Constellation may share information regarding your activities on our Site or other Service with those third parties pursuant to your authorization, and they may associate that information with Personally Identifiable Information they already have about you (such as your Facebook Profile) and use it to improve their site or services or for other purposes. Constellation does not control the privacy policies of such third parties, and their privacy policies will govern their use of your information once it has been transmitted by Constellation.

Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third parties that you authorize to gather information from Constellation.

Constellation may transfer the Personally Identifiable Information it collects to any affiliates, trusted business partners or joint venturers, or successors in interest to Constellation, such as a company that acquires Constellation. Constellation may also disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation or legal process requires it, or if Constellation determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Constellation's rights or the rights of another user.

  </p>
  <h4>Disclosure of Information in Public Areas</h4>
  <p>If you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information in a public area of the Site or other Service, such as a rating/review page, chat room or message board, that information may be collected and used by a third party to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements or for other purposes. Constellation does not control the actions of users in public areas of the Site or other Service. If you disclose Personally Identifiable Information in a public area, you do so at your own risk.
