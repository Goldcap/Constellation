  <h2>Constellation Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Last Revised: June 21, 2011
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Constellation, Inc. ("Constellation") is concerned about your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how it collects, uses and shares your information. Constellation collects some or all of the following information whenever you sign up for or use the various Constellation services and products, including without limitation the Constellation Web site, any other Web site owned or operated by Constellation (each a "Site"), online mobile service, and/or purchase movie or other event tickets, or other products or services offered by Constellation or any affiliate (collectively, the "Service"). Some of this information is collected automatically and some is collected only when you provide it voluntarily.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Constellation is not designed or intended for use by children under 13. If you are under 18, you should use Constellation only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not submit any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy pp_title">Anti-Spam Policy
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Constellation is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam"). We do not have any desire to send unsolicited marketing emails to anyone without permission and we do not sell or provide email addresses to any unauthorized third party in violation of this Privacy Policy. If you receive any unsolicited emails from spammers, please be assured that Constellation did not provide your email address to such parties.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. Unfortunately, spammers obtain email addresses in a number of devious ways, including when you respond and ask to be taken off a spam email list, and in some cases by just generating emails to millions of random email addresses in the hopes of getting a few "live" ones. Please be assured that at Constellation we hate spam as much as you do, and we do our best to avoid contributing to it.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">All of our newsletters and other general email marketing communications also include an "unsubscribe" opt-out link that you may use to ask that we discontinue such emails to you. (Even if you opt-out of our newsletter or other marketing communications, we may still send you certain transactional or administrative emails, such as email tickets, recommendations, or invitations if a third party has entered your email address and wishes to invite you to a screening on Constellation.)
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">All that said, if you believe that you have gotten unsolicited email from us, please <a href="mailto: info@constellation.tv">Contact Us</a> and we will investigate. If you prefer not to receive any further marketing communications from us, just tell us and we'll try to make sure you never hear from us again.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy pp_title">What Types of Information does Constellation Collect?
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Personally Identifiable Information.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, credit/debit card number and expiration date (or other payment-method information), login ID, member name and password ("Personally Identifiable Information"). When you sign up for or use the Site or other Service, Constellation collects some amount of Personally Identifiable Information from you. Constellation also collects Personally Identifiable Information that you may voluntarily provide when you use the Site or other Service, that you may disclose in a public area of the Site or other Service (such as a rating/review page, message board or chat room), or that you may include if you communicate with Constellation. In addition, when you use certain features of the Site or other Service (such as sending email invitations to others), Constellation will collect the email addresses or other Personally Identifiable Information of others that you may provide for such purposes.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Constellation collects information from you automatically when you use the Site or other Service. However, the information that Constellation collects automatically does not contain Personally Identifiable Information. The automatically collected information may include information such as your browser type, the URL of the previous Web sites you visited, the Web pages and advertisements you view or select, the type of Service you use and the searches you conduct. This information also may include the movies for which you buy tickets. Constellation also collects information that does not include Personally Identifiable Information when you voluntarily provide it (such as in response to a questionnaire or survey) or post it to a public area of the Site or other Service (such as a rating/review page, message board or chat room).

  </p>
  <p class = "privacy-policy">Where authorized and as permitted by FTC guidelines and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations, Constellation may also use or allow the use of web beacons, trusted vendors and other third party companies who may gather data for purposes of advertising and/or to report website traffic and statistics. Constellation may also use other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous statistics about our website visitors.

Constellation does not control the privacy policies of such third parties, and their privacy policies will govern their use of your information once it has been transmitted by Constellation. Constellation assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third parties that you authorize to gather information from Constellation.
