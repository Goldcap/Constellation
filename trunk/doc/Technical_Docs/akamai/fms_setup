On regular machines, FMS works both on Fedora 14 and Windows (7, Professional)
On AWS it only works on Windows Server 10, 64 bit architecture.
The following AWS image (ami) works: ami-0535d66c 

(FMS Admin is Here: http://localhost:8134/)

On Windows
-----------
1) Download the free trial version on Flash media Server
and install it on the default location. When it asks for a
serial-number, just hit return and it will install the 
Development version of FMS. The FMS can be found here: 
http://www.adobe.com/products/flashmediaserver/

The <install_dir> will be c:\Program Files\Adobe\Flash Media Server4\

2) Go to <install_dir> and create the folder akamaiTest there
   Copy the files 
   		Application.xml
		main.asc
		config.asc
		md5.asc
	to it from the customCode/eprepublish.zip folder (in svn)

    a) Modify config.asc and put in the parmeters that correspond to
       the akamai ingress, userid and password    
	b) Akamai ids for the stream which was given to us when we set up the
	   stream at akamai https://control.akamai.com
	   1) Akamai stream id (from their portal page when the stream is setup)
	   	  var AKAMAI_STREAM_ID = 43841;
	   2) The Akamai republish id (also form their portal page )
	   var AKAMAI_STREAM="testStream@43841";

3) Restart fms
   All Programs -> Adobe -> Adobe Media Server 4 -> Stop Adobe Media Server 4
   All Programs -> Adobe -> Adobe Media Server 4 -> Start Adobe Media Server 4

4) Stream an rtmp stream to FMS (for ffmpeg installation) see ffmpef file
   a) Open a dos console (All Programs->Accessories-Command Prompt)
   b) Run the following command there
     ffmpeg -i <video_file> -re -ar 22050 -vcodec libx264 -vpre fast -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/test
   (the <video_file> can be any video file
     ffmpeg -i <video_file> -re -ar 22050 -vcodec libx264 -vpre fast -f flv rtmp://localhost/akamaiTest/testStream
   
5) Check if it is streaming in the FMS builtin Flash player
   a) Open http://localhost/ in a browser
   	  You should see the Adobe FMS Splash screen with two videos.
   b) Clock on the tab that says "Interactive"
   	  You will see another page with two videos 
   c) On the video on the right enter
   Server: rtmp://cp113557.live.edgefcs.net/live/ 
   <!--http://localhost/akamaiTest-->
   Stream: testStream@43841

   In this case akamaiTest is the name of the application and 
   testStream@43841 is the name of the stream. These correspond to 
   the last target parameter given to ffmpeg and to the name of the 
   stream that was setup at Akamai. 


   d) Hit the "Play stream" that appears in the middle of the right video screen
   The video streamed from ffmpeg <video_file> should play
