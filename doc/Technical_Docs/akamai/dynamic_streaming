Howto setup Dynamic Streaming on Akamai.
----------------------------------------

Base: c:\Program Files\Adobe\Flash Media Server4\

Notes: Should work without changes on the openplayer, and on the flowplayer.

1) Turn on dynamic streaming through the Akamai control page
Manage Streams -> Configure Format -> Edit
(Click Dynamic/MBR)

2) Send multiple streams out to the akamai entry point. 
   a) Create multiple applications in FMS
      For example if you want to create two streams ds1 and ds2

	  Create 2 applications instances in FMS:
	  	  Create 2 directories <base>\applications\ds1Test and 
	  		 <base>\applications\ds2Test 
   	  	  copy the contents of <base>\applications\akamaiTest to each of
	  	   these two directories.
		  
    b) Restart FMS
 	   i ) Start -> All Programs -> Adobe -> Flash Media Server 4 -> Stop Server
 	   ii ) Start -> All Programs -> Adobe -> Flash Media Server 4 -> Start Server
	c) Send two streams to the two FMS application instances created
	  i) ffmpeg -i <file1> -re -ar 22050 -vcodec libx264 -vpre medium 
	  -f flv rtmp://localhost/ds1Test/ds1@43841
	  ii) ffmpeg -i <file2> -re -ar 22050 -vcodec libx264 -vpre medium 
	  -f flv rtmp://localhost/ds2Test/ds2@43841

	d) Check that you can see the two streams on the akamai suppot potal. 
	  i) rtmp://cp113557.live.edgefcs.net/live/ds1@43841
	  ii) rtmp://cp113557.live.edgefcs.net/live/ds2@43841


3) Create a SMIL file listing the various names and bitrates. 
   A sample is below
<smil>
  <head>
    <meta base="rtmp://cp113557.live.edgefcs.net/live" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <switch>
      <video src="ds1@43841" system-bitrate="12000"/>
      <video src="ds2@43841" system-bitrate="24000"/>
    </switch>
  </body>
</smil>

  Save it as <somename>.smil (say dsTest.smil)

4) Provide this file name int the url in your web server that calls the
video player. See http://flowplayer.org/plugins/streaming/smil.html
on instructions about how to do this. 

   It basically involves

   a) Downloading a bandwidth plugin (.swf) from flowplayer.
   b) Downloading a smil plugin (.swf) from flowplayer.
   c) Setting up the html correctly. 

   Look at ../flowplayer/dsTest.smil and ../flowplayer/dsTest.html 
   for an example on howto use smil and bandwidth-checking and 
   dynamic streaming with flowplayer.
