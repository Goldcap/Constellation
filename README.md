Constellation
=============

<h2>Overview</h2>
Constellation.tv was a project written in a modified version of Symfony 1.4. I took the standard 
MVC Pattern and converted both controller and view layers into a widget factory, using yml page descriptors 
to collect widgets into a templated output format.

The notable code for this operiation is a plugin located here:
